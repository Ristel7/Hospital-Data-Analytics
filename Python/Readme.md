📘 Hospital Data Analytics — Jupyter Notebook Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (Hospital-Data-Analytics.ipynb) contains a complete end-to-end exploratory and statistical analysis of hospital operational data. The notebook combines Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate rich visual insights from eight core hospital datasets, including patient records, appointments, treatments, billing, surgery outcomes, doctor performance, insurance details, and feedback.

The notebook is structured in a step-by-step analytical workflow — starting from data loading and cleaning, followed by univariate, bivariate, multivariate, exploratory, inferential, and comparative analytics. Each section is designed to break down the complexity of hospital data and transform it into meaningful insights for decision-making.

⭐ Key Features of the Notebook
1. Data Import & Preparation

Loads all eight CSV files into separate Pandas DataFrames

Handles missing values and inconsistent formatting

Standardizes column names for uniform and error-free analysis

2. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics for all tables

Distribution plots, histograms, KDE curves

Missing value heatmaps

Outlier exploration using boxplots

Correlation matrices to identify key relationships

3. Visual Analytics Across All Tables

Over 80 high-quality visualizations covering themes like:

Patient demographics

Appointment patterns and time trends

Doctor performance and workload distribution

Treatment and procedure behavior

Billing patterns and revenue segmentation

Surgery outcomes and success rates

Insurance coverage impact

Patient feedback and satisfaction

Each visualization is paired with a clear title, labels, and clean aesthetics for easy interpretation.

4. Statistical & Inferential Analysis

Includes:

Hypothesis testing (t-tests, Chi-square tests, proportion tests)

A/B testing scenarios such as:

Male vs Female treatment cost

MRI vs X-Ray waiting times

Insurance vs Non-insurance billing differences

P-values and significance decisions included

5. Time-Series and Trend Analysis

Monthly and yearly trends for appointments

Revenue growth curves

Seasonal patterns in hospital operations

6. Multivariate Analysis

Scatterplots with hue grouping

Pairplots connecting multiple variables

Cross-tabulation and stacked bar insights

7. Insights & Interpretation

Throughout the notebook, every visualization is followed by short insight paragraphs that explain what the chart reveals about hospital performance — making the notebook informative even for non-technical viewers.
